In fluid dynamics, the starting flow through a narrow slit gives rise to a distinctive fluid mass due to the lateral rolling caused by vorticity induced at the slit tip. This process generates a counter-rotating vortex pair in planar or two-dimensional flows. In this study, considering a flow evolution model, we show that the growth rate of this ejected fluid rate scales as $\propto \sqrt{time}$. We draw a comparison on how does this vortex pair behave in an in-channel doamin which has bounded the wall boundaries. We observed that bounded walls amplify vorticity, and lower the leading vortex pair's progression rate due to the wall offered resistance. In contrast, the bounded channel walls sustain the vortex pair's form for an extended duration before they diffuse away as shear layer instabilities take effect. It is known that these vortex pairs do not undergo any propulsive detachment known as `pinch-off' from the tip-attached fluid layer. This study envision to instigate 'pinch-off' phenomenon in these vortex pairs using flexible slit walls, aiming to enhance the momentum transport potential of vortex pairs capitalizing on their self-propagating properties.
			Transitioning our focus to flexible slit walls, we unveil that the mutual relationship between flexible structures and fluid dynamics holds significance in diverse applications such as vortex formation and flow modulation. The flexibility of these plates prompts them to adapt under fluid forces and exhibit temporally oscillating behavior of the slit gap. We unearth a critical plate flexibility case which induces pinch-off in the resultant vortex pair, a phenomenon absent in the case of rigid plates. We explain that this pinch-off phenomenon is associated with the time scale of the oscillatory retraction of the flexible plates. The induced periodic pinch-off in the flow subsequently forms a train of vortex pairs through the channel. Furthermore, the study highlights the maximum propagation rate of the leading vortex pair in the channel, observed at a specific plate flexibility case with critical Cauchy number $=0.04$. These findings contribute to an enhanced understanding of fluid-structure dynamics, with broader implications in engineering and physics. The newfound insights into inducing and controlling vortex pair behaviors pave the way for innovative applications in various domains, spanning from fluid transport to advanced flow manipulation techniques.
