In this paper we show that the hypothesis that at the pinch off the translational velocity of the ring equals the jet flow velocity near the ring is equivalent to the recently proposed idea based on a variational principle by Kelvin and Benjamin that the pinch off occurs when the apparatus is no longer able to deliver energy at a rate required for steady vortex ring existence. A formula for the propagation velocity of a thick vortex ring is also proposed and compared with available experimental data and empirical relations.}",

Both water and land plants reconfigure in response to this drag, and this is presumed to reduce the risk of mechanical failure. However, there is little unequivocal evidence of drag reduction in large trees as a result of reconfiguration. Land plants must also transport water internally to their tissues, and many have developed xylem tracheids and vessels that help speed up this process. Recent evidence that tree height is limited by water supply suggests that water transport efficiency must be a crucial element in tree design. However, the resistance of many parts of the xylem is still unknown. More focused work is urgently required to shed light on the evolution and ecology of plants in relation to the flow of fluids.}",

This work presents an evaluation of a two-dimensional moving rigid heart valve, in which a fictitious domain method is used to describe fluid–structure interaction. Valve motion and fluid flow around the valve were computed for several Reynolds and Strouhal numbers. Particle Image Velocimetry measurements in an in vitro experimental set-up were performed to validate the computational results. The influences of variations of the flow-pulse, expressed in Reynolds and Strouhal number, are well predicted by the computational method. As the fictitious domain method can readily be applied to fully three-dimensional fluid–structure interaction problems, this study indicates that this method is well suited for the analysis of valve dynamics and ventricular flow in physiologically realistic geometries."
