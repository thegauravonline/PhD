	journal = {Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering},

	abstract = {Passive mixers rely on the channel geometry to mix fluids. However, many previously reported designs either work efficiently only at moderate to high Reynolds numbers (Re), or require a complex 3D channel geometry that is often difficult to fabricate. In this paper, we report design, simulation, fabrication and characterization of a planar passive microfluidic mixer capable of mixing at low Reynolds numbers. The design incorporates diamond-shaped obstructions within the microchannel to break-up and recombine the flow. Simulation and experimental results of the developed micromixer show excellent mixing performance over a wide range of flow conditions (numerically: 0.01 &lt; Re &lt; 100, experimentally: 0.02 &lt; Re &lt; 10). The micromixer is also characterized by low pressure drop, an important characteristic for integration into complex, cascading microfluidic systems. Due to the simple planar structure of the micromixer, it can be easily realized and integrated with on-chip microfluidic systems, such as micro total analysis systems (μTAS) or lab on a chip (LOC).}

As examples of the study, the flow dynamics at the Naruto strait and the Tohoku district off Japan are selected. In the Naturo strait, the Coriolis effect is not important, and the exchanging process in the strait can be described on the basis of simple vortex pair model. In the Tohoku district, the movements of the coastal water are geostrophic in nature and are affected by the oceanic currents. The large scale eddies produced by interactions between various currents may entrain occasionally the coastal water mass in it and may maintain it for a long period, say, several months.}

A formula for the propagation velocity of a thick vortex ring is also proposed and compared with available experimental data and empirical relations.}",

Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is used together with a phase-locking technique, in order to measure the velocities. Particular emphasis is placed on the viscous stresses and their local maxima, which are analyzed and discussed in detail. It is observed that the rate-of-strain, the vorticity, and the stress fields, attain higher local values as the curvature is increased. Moreover, the peak values of these quantities occur near the mid-cycle (i.e. at t/T~0.5) and have slower decay rates in the case of curved plates. This study is motivated by the need to understand the fluid–structure interactions in the context of prosthetic heart valve design.}

Both water and land plants reconfigure in response to this drag, and this is presumed to reduce the risk of mechanical failure. However, there is little unequivocal evidence of drag reduction in large trees as a result of reconfiguration. Land plants must also transport water internally to their tissues, and many have developed xylem tracheids and vessels that help speed up this process. Recent evidence that tree height is limited by water supply suggests that water transport efficiency must be a crucial element in tree design. However, the resistance of many parts of the xylem is still unknown. More focused work is urgently required to shed light on the evolution and ecology of plants in relation to the flow of fluids.}",

	abstract = "Flow phenomena around heart valves are important for the motion of the valve leaflets, hence the dynamics of the valve. This work presents an evaluation of a two-dimensional moving rigid heart valve, in which a fictitious domain method is used to describe fluid–structure interaction. Valve motion and fluid flow around the valve were computed for several Reynolds and Strouhal numbers. Particle Image Velocimetry measurements in an in vitro experimental set-up were performed to validate the computational results. The influences of variations of the flow-pulse, expressed in Reynolds and Strouhal number, are well predicted by the computational method. As the fictitious domain method can readily be applied to fully three-dimensional fluid–structure interaction problems, this study indicates that this method is well suited for the analysis of valve dynamics and ventricular flow in physiologically realistic geometries."

	abstract = {We have studied the motion of a pair of unequal-sized bubbles rising inline in a quiescent liquid column, using the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method. In our work, a wide range of Archimedes numbers (400<Ar<5000) is used to study the bubbles’ shape, rise-velocities, and the wake region. We found that the leading bubble is unaffected by the proximity of the trailing bubble and moves with its terminal speed, whereas, the trailing bubble shows an acceleration with an increase in its speed as it approaches the leading bubble. We have also examined the wake behaviour behind the bubbles using the pressure distribution and extracted the vortex structures using the Q-criterion. Our work has unveiled two dominant vortex structures in the wake: (1) a toroidal ring on the bubble surface near the maximum diameter plane which occasionally detaches, and (2) a set of hairpin-like structures near the rear stagnation point, which grows by diffusion. The interaction between the toroidal ring and the hairpins determine the overall wake features.}

	abstract = {Under laminar flow conditions, when no external forces are applied, particles are generally thought to follow fluid streamlines. Contrary to this perspective, we observe that flowing particles migrate across streamlines in a continuous, predictable, and accurate manner in microchannels experiencing laminar flows. The migration is attributed to lift forces on particles that are observed when inertial aspects of the flow become significant. We identified symmetric and asymmetric channel geometries that provide additional inertial forces that bias particular equilibrium positions to create continuous streams of ordered particles precisely positioned in three spatial dimensions. We were able to order particles laterally, within the transverse plane of the channel, with \&gt;80-nm accuracy, and longitudinally, in regular chains along the direction of flow. A fourth dimension of rotational alignment was observed for discoidal red blood cells. Unexpectedly, ordering appears to be independent of particle buoyant direction, suggesting only minor centrifugal contributions. Theoretical analysis indicates the physical principles are operational over a range of channel and particle length scales. The ability to differentially order particles of different sizes, continuously, at high rates, and without external forces in microchannels is expected to have a broad range of applications in continuous bioparticle separation, high-throughput cytometry, and large-scale filtration systems.}}

		ABSTRACT = {Microfluidic devices have attracted increasing attention in the fields of biomedical diagnostics, food safety control, environmental protection, and animal epidemic prevention. Micromixing has a considerable impact on the efficiency and sensitivity of microfluidic devices. This work reviews recent advances on the passive and active micromixers for the development of various microfluidic chips. Recently reported active micromixers driven by pressure fields, electrical fields, sound fields, magnetic fields, and thermal fields, etc. and passive micromixers, which owned two-dimensional obstacles, unbalanced collisions, spiral and convergence-divergence structures or three-dimensional lamination and spiral structures, were summarized and discussed. The future trends for micromixers to combine with 3D printing and paper channel were brought forth as well.}

		abstract  ="Continuous multiphase flow strategies are commonly employed for high-throughput parameter screening of physical{,} chemical{,} and biological processes as well as continuous preparation of a wide range of fine chemicals and micro/nano particles with processing times up to 10 min. The inter-dependency of mixing and residence times{,} and their direct correlation with reactor length have limited the adaptation of multiphase flow strategies for studies of processes with relatively long processing times (0.5–24 h). In this frontier article{,} we describe an oscillatory multiphase flow strategy to decouple mixing and residence times and enable investigation of longer timescale experiments than typically feasible with conventional continuous multiphase flow approaches. We review current oscillatory multiphase flow technologies{,} provide an overview of the advancements of this relatively new strategy in chemistry and biology{,} and close with a perspective on future opportunities."}

Different modes of dynamic behavior in the single-filament and dual-filament systems were identified. The wake structures associated with different modes of dynamic behavior were compared.

For this purpose, we use both flat side walls and corrugated side walls with attached sharp tips to measure both the steady state flow and the primary instability. Furthermore, we vary the channel width as well as the stream wise distance between the tips. We report on two different stabilizing effects: (1) A stabilization against free surface perturbations due to the reduction of the channel width that appears for flat side walls as well as for corrugated side walls. (2) A distinct maximum in the stabilization for corrugated side walls when varying the tip distance. A stabilization up to five times the value for the classical two dimensional Nusselt flow was possible. All measurements are consistent with the limiting cases. For the limit of very broad channels, the effect of the side walls vanishes. For the limits of very small and very large tip distances, the side walls correspond to flat side walls. Finally, we bring together the basic flow with the measured shifts in the instability. To our knowledge, this is the first work which reports the effect of corrugated side walls on gravity-driven film flows. Since stable, uniform thin films are of major interest for many technical applications and side walls are often unavoidable, we expand the knowledge of film flows with side walls and present a method to significantly improve their stability.}",

The film flow developed an identifiable statically deformed free surface with a wavelength similar to the substrate for most cases of corrugation shape and tip width. The amplitude and phase shift of the statically deformed free surface, as well as the steady-state film thickness, varied more with tip width than with corrugation shape. Transient fluctuations in the free surface elevation were examined for evidence of periodic traveling waves. In general, the film flow produced transient free surface fluctuations, and in many cases, periodic traveling waves with parameters that varied similarly with corrugation shape as with tip width. For flow conditions that produced positive phase shift, low amplitude, or minimal curvature of the statically deformed free surface, transient and periodic behavior were suppressed, supporting previous findings on the importance of the shape and position of the statically deformed free surface. An increase in corrugation tip width also reduced the transient and periodic response. These two findings implicate flow dynamics in the substrate trough as a leading factor in the development of transient and periodic behavior. Steady-state response and the existence of time-dependent behavior are influenced more by tip width than corrugation shape, in agreement with two-dimensional film flow over topography; however, transient fluctuation and periodic traveling wave parameters are similarly influenced by corrugation shape and tip width, which contrasts two-dimensional findings.}",

	products, people gradually realize that the mixing capacity of
	extruders cannot meet the requirements of fully mixing
	materials, especially for nano-composites, colored products. In
	order to improve the mixing level of materials, static mixers
	are widely used. Researchers developed different types of static
	mixers to meet the purpose of homogenizing different materials.
	The mixed materials can achieve different levels of mixing with
	different types of static mixers, which provided a favorable
	research condition to study the change of the properties of the
	mixed materials. Objective:: This paper reviews the research
	progress of different types of static mixers in polymer
	processing, including the improvement of processing equipment,
	processing methods and static mixers, and expounds the influence
	of different types of static mixers and different processing
	methods on polymers. Methods: The paper reviews various patents
	and research developments about the structure of different types
	of static mixers, and the application of static mixers in
	plastic processing. It also analyzes the advantages and
	disadvantages of a variety of patented technologies from the
	aspects of internal structure, micro-morphology, test methods,

	mixer in plastic processing, the current and future development
	trend of static mixer in plastic processing is put forward to

	Static mixers are widely used to improve the performance of
	mixtures. In recent years, there are many researches on the
	application of static mixer to improve the morphology,

	cases are studied and they differ by the number of alternating
	flaps and by the presence or absence of two co-planar flaps
	upstream. The Reynolds number is held constant with a value of
	2000 based on the hydraulic diameter of the channel. The

	investigated. The mixing process is quantified by solving the

	index. The results show that mixing is enhanced for larger flaps
	displacement achieving up to 99\% in mixing homogeneity.

	results of an empty channel, show a great ability to reduce the
	thickness of the thermal boundary layer and to enhance heat
	transfer resulting in up to 275\% increase in the global Nusselt

	identify vortex transitions from primary to secondary vortices
	and from secondary to tertiary vortices and to explore the
	mechanisms for these transitions. In addition, the variations of
	the force coefficients and Strouhal numbers with the transitions
	are also examined. Based on the characteristics of vortex
	shedding frequency, flow patterns, and force coefficients on the
	cylinders, four flow regimes, namely, no-shedding, primary
	shedding, secondary shedding, and tertiary shedding regimes,
	were mapped out in the Re--G/D domain. The three shedding
	regimes always initiate from the last cylinder. With the
	increase of Re and/or G/D, the onset locations of the regimes
	shift upstream. The secondary and tertiary vortices are formed
	after a region of convective instability characterized by
	two-row parallel vortex streets or shear layers. Two physical
	mechanisms for the transition from primary to secondary vortices
	are identified. The first one is associated with shear layer
	instabilities developed after the decay of the primary vortices,
	and the second one is the merging of the primary vortices. The
	transition from secondary to tertiary vortices involves vortex
	merging only. Whereas no-shedding or primary shedding regimes
	occur at smaller gap ratios or lower Reynolds numbers, the three
	vortex shedding patterns (primary, secondary, and tertiary) can
	co-exist for larger gap ratios or higher Reynolds numbers, and
	each pattern dominates a region around the group of cylinders.
	The variations of the flow patterns, vortex shedding frequency,
	and force coefficients on the cylinders in each of the flow
	regimes are quantified and interpreted. When the number of
	cylinders is increased to more than 6 at a gap ratio of 15, no
	further transition is observed after the transition to tertiary
	wake, and the vortex shedding processes on the downstream
	cylinders become chaotic without a dominant frequency,
	suggesting that for multiple tandem cylinders, only two
	transitions, corresponding to the generations of the secondary

	abstract  = "A high level of mixing by passive means is a desirable feature
	in microchannels for various applications, and use of flexible
	obstacles (or plates) is one of the prime choices in that
	regard. To gain further insight, we carry out two-dimensional
	numerical simulations for flow past one or two flexible plates
	anchored to a channel's opposite walls using a fluid-structure
	interaction framework. For the inlet flow Reynolds number vs the
	Strouhal number plane, we observe a sudden flow change from a
	laminar to a time-periodic vortex shedding state when flexible
	plates are present in the channel. We found the critical
	Reynolds number to be Re\_\{cr\}$\approx$370 when a single plate
	is anchored on the channel wall and Re\_\{cr\}$\approx$290 or
	even lower when two plates are anchored. With an increase in the
	inlet flow Reynolds number (up to 3200), we found that vortices
	detach regularly at the plates' tips, which causes the flow to
	meander in the channel. In a two-plate anchored configuration,
	primary vortices generated at the first plate are constrained by
	the second plate and result in an energetic secondary vortex
	generation in the downstream side. The overall flow features and
	the energy dissipation in the channel are mainly controlled by
	the separation gap between the plates. At high-inlet-flow
	Reynolds numbers ($\geq$1600), the probability density function
	(F) of the kinetic energy dissipation in a flexible plate
	configuration shows a stretched exponential shape in the form
	F(Z)∼1/sqrt[Z]e^\{-pZ^\{q\}\}, where Z is the normalized kinetic
	energy dissipation and the constants p=0.89 and q=0.86. The
	observed increase in energy dissipation comes at the cost of an
	increase in pressure loss in the channel, and we found that the
	loss is inversely related to the plates' separation gap. From
	our simulations, we found that if high mixing levels are
	desired, then two flexible plates anchored to the channel walls
