In channel mixers with two parallel streams of fluid, mixing is achieved by either laminar diffusion at low Reynolds numbers or from flow agitation due to geometric variations. Traditionally, rigid obstructions or textures are used in various spatial arrangements to improve fluid mixing. In our work, we have numerically investigated the mixing performance of a passive scalar in a two-dimensional channel flow accompanied by wall-mounted flexible plates as obstructions for a wide range of low Reynolds numbers ($Re$). The thin plates are arranged on opposite walls of the channel, and the distance between them is varied in the range $0h$ to $2h$, where $h$ is the channel lateral width. The different arrangements result in corresponding flow paths, thereby affecting fluid mixing and flow rate due to the pressure head losses. We assessed the mixing performance in the channel via the mixing index and the head loss. Our results show that the channel with the two plates when arranged exactly opposite the walls (without a separation gap), offers the highest mixing with significant pressure drop. In contrast, either a single plate or two plates widely separated result in nearly similar levels of mixing index with a lower head loss. We devised a performance index based on a cost-benefit analogy by comparing the flexible plate configurations with the plane channel (i.e, without any obstruction) so as to assess the mixing effectiveness and found that a single flexible plate in the channel in the flow conditions with $Re\approx400$ suit the best for the mixing of two fluid in the channel.
		%	Fluid mixing in channel flows is essential in industries like chemical engineering and food processing. Our study utilized two flexible wall-mounted plates in a channel of height \(h\) to investigate mixing at various Reynolds numbers (\(Re\)). The channel flow featured a scalar field with two initially separated concentration fields. Interaction between fluid, structure, and scalar fields induced agitation, leading to intermixing. We varied the positions of the plates, separated by a distance \(d=0h-2h\), to form different obstructing configurations, affecting fluid mixing and flow rate due to pressure head losses. We assessed mixing performance using the 'Mixing Index' and 'Head Loss' along the channel length. Results indicated that the setup with \(d=0\) offered the highest mixing early in the channel but caused significant pressure drops. Conversely, a single plate and other configurations yielded similar mixing levels for \(Re>400\), with head losses increasing as \(d\) is decreased.
