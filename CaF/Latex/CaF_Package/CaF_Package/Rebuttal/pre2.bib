	abstract = {Microreactors are very attractive for intensifying chemical and biochemical reactions, as they enable a large heat transfer with high control of the operating conditions. These features allow improving the achievable reaction yield and selectivity. However, the mixing of reactants should be ensured, especially in simple designs, as the flow regime is laminar. This work aims at characterizing the flow regimes and degree of mixing in a X-shaped micromixer with two opposite inlets and at investigating how these regimes are affected by fluid properties. To this purpose we carry out numerical simulations of two different mixtures, i.e. Water-Water (W-W) and Water-Ethanol (W-E), for Reynolds numbers Re⩽200, to gain insight into the complex three-dimensional flow structures stemming from the impinging jets at the confluence. Besides, experimental flow visualizations from the W-W case provide a validation of the numerical model. The X-shaped reactor is observed to enable a superior mixing performance compared to T-, Y-, and Arrow-shaped microreactors, which are extensively employed.}

	abstract = {Numerical simulations were performed to study the mixing dynamics of two miscible liquids within a T-shaped micromixer, comparing the case where the two inlet fluids are both water (W–W) with that where they consist of water and ethanol (W–E). We showed that at smaller Reynolds number, Re<100, there is no vortex formation for either cases; therefore, mixing water and ethanol is slightly easier than mixing water with water because the residence time of the fluid occupying the interfacial region in the W–E case is larger than that of the W–W case. On the other hand, at larger Reynolds numbers, mixing water and ethanol may take considerably longer, as the onset of engulfment is retarded and occurs at larger Reynolds number. All these behaviors are due to the fact that, as a W–E mixture has a viscosity that is up to almost three times larger than that of water, at the confluence of the T-mixer the two streams are separated by a viscous layer of a W–E mixture, that hampers vortex formation and retards mixing.}

	abstract = {In this article we propose a new conservative high resolution TVD (total variation diminishing) finite volume scheme with time-accurate local time stepping (LTS) on unstructured grids for the solution of scalar transport problems, which are typical in the context of water quality simulations. To keep the presentation of the new method as simple as possible, the algorithm is only derived in two space dimensions and for purely convective transport problems, hence neglecting diffusion and reaction terms. The new numerical method for the solution of the scalar transport is directly coupled to the hydrodynamic model of Casulli and Walters (2000) that provides the dynamics of the free surface and the velocity vector field based on a semi-implicit discretization of the shallow water equations. Wetting and drying is handled rigorously by the nonlinear algorithm proposed by Casulli (2009). The new time-accurate LTS algorithm allows a different time step size for each element of the unstructured grid, based on an element-local Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) stability condition. The proposed method does not need any synchronization between different time steps of different elements and is by construction locally and globally conservative. The LTS scheme is based on a piecewise linear polynomial reconstruction in space–time using the MUSCL–Hancock method, to obtain second order of accuracy in both space and time. The new algorithm is first validated on some classical test cases for pure advection problems, for which exact solutions are known. In all cases we obtain a very good level of accuracy, showing also numerical convergence results; we furthermore confirm mass conservation up to machine precision and observe an improved computational efficiency compared to a standard second order TVD scheme for scalar transport with global time stepping (GTS). Then, the new LTS method is applied to some more complex problems, where the new scalar transport scheme has also been coupled to a semi-implicit model for the simulation of the free surface hydrodynamics, including nonlinear wetting and drying. The last application shown in this paper is carried out on a real geometry, for which we have taken available DTM data of the lake Guaiba in Brazil. Comparisons have been made in all cases with a second order TVD scheme based on GTS. For the new LTS algorithm we report a significant reduction in computational effort, with a savings of CPU time of the order of up to 95%.}

	abstract = {Abstract Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is very appealing to investigate mixing and reaction in microdevices, as it allows easily investigating different operating conditions as well as mixer geometries. This latter aspect is very important as the flow in microdevices is laminar so the mixing between reactants should be promoted by a clever mixer design, aimed at breaking the flow symmetries. Recently time periodic motions that improve mixing have been observed to take place in a T-junction at low Reynolds numbers. In this case the numerical modelling should be based on direct numerical simulations (DNS), thus involving high computational resources. In this work, two different CFD approaches, i.e., finite volume and spectral element methods, are applied and compared for the analysis of the mixing process in the well known T-shaped micromixer. Spectral elements methods are particularly suited for DNS; however, they have been scarcely applied to study micromixers, while plenty of works can be found with finite volume methods. The analysis is carried out using both ideal and non-ideal liquid binary mixtures, the latter presenting a negative fluidity of mixing (i.e., the viscosity of the mixture is higher than that of the pure components). Moreover the numerical results are validated with simple flow visualization experiments.},

We validate with uniform velocity and turbulent flow simulations showing that numerical diffusion error matches FVM results while numerical dispersion is reduced.

The cross (that is lateral) transfer is largely due to macroscopic instabilities developing at two shear layers. The characteristic size and advection velocity of the instabilities favorably compare with experimental results from the literature on a geometrically similar system. The strength of the cross flow strongly depends on the Reynolds number, with cross flow developing only for Reynolds numbers (based on macroscopic flow quantities) larger than 1360. Mass transfer between the sub-channels has been assessed by adding a passive scalar to the flow and solving its transport equation. As a result of the intimate connection of cross flow and lateral mass transfer, also the mass transfer coefficient is a pronounced function of Re.}

	abstract = {Pulsating flow through bifurcations are of general interest. In the human body such flows are also very common; for example in blood vessels and the respiratory tract. The characteristics of the flow in arteries have been related to the process of atherogenesis, based on the observation that the initial manifestation of the process is observed at certain common locations, i.e., near bifurcations in vessels of certain size. In-spite of these observations there is no direct understanding between the flow itself and the pathological process. In fact, the flow itself is rather complex since it is unsteady and transitional. The paper considers both unsteady- and steady-flow through a three generation system of (non-symmetric) bifurcations. The geometry consists of a 90°. bifurcation followed by two sets of consecutive symmetric bifurcations. The aim of the paper is to investigate the effects of the bifurcations on the flow and mass transport in such a geometrical configuration that is often found in physiological situations. Additionally, the effects of different inlet velocity conditions have been considered. The different inlet conditions are aimed at studying the sensitivity to variations of inflow conditions; variations found under normal physiological conditions. The results show that the geometrical asymmetry affects the velocity distribution even after a second bifurcation downstream. Two generations down this asymmetry does not have a significant effect anymore. The different inlet conditions affect the flow to the next generation of branches during parts of the cycle. At peak flow and further downstream in the system the effects are negligible. It is also found that over a cycle the mass flow distribution through the outlets can be affected by the inlet velocity conditions. The distribution of a passive scalar is not uniform but depends on the inlet conditions and the Schmidt number (i.e., molecular diffusion).}

The computations use Large Eddy Simulation (LES) to account for turbulence, and either Volume Of Fluid (VOF) for the initial break-up or Lagrangian Particle Tracking (LPT) with droplet break-up model in the case of liquid droplets injected into the ambient gas. The results show that, depending on the physical properties of the liquid and ambient gas, the initial break-up and turbulent mixing can be enhanced substantially with intermittent injection. The numerical modeling is validated by recovering key results of experimental and analytical works. It can be observed that a main effect during the mixing is the suction of ambient fluid at the tail of the injected liquid, which depends on the fluid properties. Increased injection frequency shows to increase the mixing significantly during the initial transient phase.}

	journal = {Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering},

	abstract = {Passive mixers rely on the channel geometry to mix fluids. However, many previously reported designs either work efficiently only at moderate to high Reynolds numbers (Re), or require a complex 3D channel geometry that is often difficult to fabricate. In this paper, we report design, simulation, fabrication and characterization of a planar passive microfluidic mixer capable of mixing at low Reynolds numbers. The design incorporates diamond-shaped obstructions within the microchannel to break-up and recombine the flow. Simulation and experimental results of the developed micromixer show excellent mixing performance over a wide range of flow conditions (numerically: 0.01 &lt; Re &lt; 100, experimentally: 0.02 &lt; Re &lt; 10). The micromixer is also characterized by low pressure drop, an important characteristic for integration into complex, cascading microfluidic systems. Due to the simple planar structure of the micromixer, it can be easily realized and integrated with on-chip microfluidic systems, such as micro total analysis systems (μTAS) or lab on a chip (LOC).}

As examples of the study, the flow dynamics at the Naruto strait and the Tohoku district off Japan are selected. In the Naturo strait, the Coriolis effect is not important, and the exchanging process in the strait can be described on the basis of simple vortex pair model. In the Tohoku district, the movements of the coastal water are geostrophic in nature and are affected by the oceanic currents. The large scale eddies produced by interactions between various currents may entrain occasionally the coastal water mass in it and may maintain it for a long period, say, several months.}

Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is used together with a phase-locking technique, in order to measure the velocities. Particular emphasis is placed on the viscous stresses and their local maxima, which are analyzed and discussed in detail. It is observed that the rate-of-strain, the vorticity, and the stress fields, attain higher local values as the curvature is increased. Moreover, the peak values of these quantities occur near the mid-cycle (i.e. at t/T~0.5) and have slower decay rates in the case of curved plates. This study is motivated by the need to understand the fluid–structure interactions in the context of prosthetic heart valve design.}

Both water and land plants reconfigure in response to this drag, and this is presumed to reduce the risk of mechanical failure. However, there is little unequivocal evidence of drag reduction in large trees as a result of reconfiguration. Land plants must also transport water internally to their tissues, and many have developed xylem tracheids and vessels that help speed up this process. Recent evidence that tree height is limited by water supply suggests that water transport efficiency must be a crucial element in tree design. However, the resistance of many parts of the xylem is still unknown. More focused work is urgently required to shed light on the evolution and ecology of plants in relation to the flow of fluids.}",

This work presents an evaluation of a two-dimensional moving rigid heart valve, in which a fictitious domain method is used to describe fluid–structure interaction. Valve motion and fluid flow around the valve were computed for several Reynolds and Strouhal numbers. Particle Image Velocimetry measurements in an in vitro experimental set-up were performed to validate the computational results. The influences of variations of the flow-pulse, expressed in Reynolds and Strouhal number, are well predicted by the computational method. As the fictitious domain method can readily be applied to fully three-dimensional fluid–structure interaction problems, this study indicates that this method is well suited for the analysis of valve dynamics and ventricular flow in physiologically realistic geometries."

In our work, a wide range of Archimedes numbers (400<Ar<5000) is used to study the bubbles’ shape, rise-velocities, and the wake region. We found that the leading bubble is unaffected by the proximity of the trailing bubble and moves with its terminal speed, whereas, the trailing bubble shows an acceleration with an increase in its speed as it approaches the leading bubble. We have also examined the wake behaviour behind the bubbles using the pressure distribution and extracted the vortex structures using the Q-criterion. Our work has unveiled two dominant vortex structures in the wake: (1) a toroidal ring on the bubble surface near the maximum diameter plane which occasionally detaches, and (2) a set of hairpin-like structures near the rear stagnation point, which grows by diffusion. The interaction between the toroidal ring and the hairpins determine the overall wake features.}

	abstract = {Under laminar flow conditions, when no external forces are applied, particles are generally thought to follow fluid streamlines. Contrary to this perspective, we observe that flowing particles migrate across streamlines in a continuous, predictable, and accurate manner in microchannels experiencing laminar flows. The migration is attributed to lift forces on particles that are observed when inertial aspects of the flow become significant. We identified symmetric and asymmetric channel geometries that provide additional inertial forces that bias particular equilibrium positions to create continuous streams of ordered particles precisely positioned in three spatial dimensions. We were able to order particles laterally, within the transverse plane of the channel, with \&gt;80-nm accuracy, and longitudinally, in regular chains along the direction of flow. A fourth dimension of rotational alignment was observed for discoidal red blood cells. Unexpectedly, ordering appears to be independent of particle buoyant direction, suggesting only minor centrifugal contributions. Theoretical analysis indicates the physical principles are operational over a range of channel and particle length scales. The ability to differentially order particles of different sizes, continuously, at high rates, and without external forces in microchannels is expected to have a broad range of applications in continuous bioparticle separation, high-throughput cytometry, and large-scale filtration systems.}}

Micromixing has a considerable impact on the efficiency and sensitivity of microfluidic devices. This work reviews recent advances on the passive and active micromixers for the development of various microfluidic chips. Recently reported active micromixers driven by pressure fields, electrical fields, sound fields, magnetic fields, and thermal fields, etc. and passive micromixers, which owned two-dimensional obstacles, unbalanced collisions, spiral and convergence-divergence structures or three-dimensional lamination and spiral structures, were summarized and discussed. The future trends for micromixers to combine with 3D printing and paper channel were brought forth as well.}

The inter-dependency of mixing and residence times{,} and their direct correlation with reactor length have limited the adaptation of multiphase flow strategies for studies of processes with relatively long processing times (0.5–24 h). In this frontier article{,} we describe an oscillatory multiphase flow strategy to decouple mixing and residence times and enable investigation of longer timescale experiments than typically feasible with conventional continuous multiphase flow approaches.

	abstract  = "Background:: With the improvement of the properties of plastic
	products, people gradually realize that the mixing capacity of
	extruders cannot meet the requirements of fully mixing
	materials, especially for nano-composites, colored products. In
	order to improve the mixing level of materials, static mixers
	are widely used. Researchers developed different types of static
	mixers to meet the purpose of homogenizing different materials.
	The mixed materials can achieve different levels of mixing with
	different types of static mixers, which provided a favorable
	research condition to study the change of the properties of the
	mixed materials. Objective:: This paper reviews the research
	progress of different types of static mixers in polymer
	processing, including the improvement of processing equipment,
	processing methods and static mixers, and expounds the influence
	of different types of static mixers and different processing
	methods on polymers. Methods: The paper reviews various patents
	and research developments about the structure of different types
	of static mixers, and the application of static mixers in
	plastic processing. It also analyzes the advantages and
	disadvantages of a variety of patented technologies from the
	aspects of internal structure, micro-morphology, test methods,
	and equipment cost. Results:: Through the application of static
	mixer in plastic processing, the current and future development
	trend of static mixer in plastic processing is put forward to
	improve the quality and properties of composites. Conclusion::
	Static mixers are widely used to improve the performance of
	mixtures. In recent years, there are many researches on the
	application of static mixer to improve the morphology,
	appearance and mechanical properties of polymer composites,
	blends as well as foams. The patents and technologies about
	static mixer provide some good references for improving the
	properties of multicomponent materials. It is still difficult to
	improve the properties of some mixtures. In order to further
	strengthen the properties of composite materials, better methods
	and equipment about static mixers are needed.",

	mechanisms for these transitions. In addition, the variations of
	the force coefficients and Strouhal numbers with the transitions
	are also examined. Based on the characteristics of vortex
	shedding frequency, flow patterns, and force coefficients on the
	cylinders, four flow regimes, namely, no-shedding, primary
	shedding, secondary shedding, and tertiary shedding regimes,
	were mapped out in the Re--G/D domain. The three shedding
	regimes always initiate from the last cylinder. With the
	increase of Re and/or G/D, the onset locations of the regimes
	shift upstream. The secondary and tertiary vortices are formed
	after a region of convective instability characterized by
	two-row parallel vortex streets or shear layers. Two physical
	mechanisms for the transition from primary to secondary vortices
	are identified. The first one is associated with shear layer
	instabilities developed after the decay of the primary vortices,

	vortex shedding patterns (primary, secondary, and tertiary) can

	each pattern dominates a region around the group of cylinders.
	The variations of the flow patterns, vortex shedding frequency,

	regimes are quantified and interpreted. When the number of
	cylinders is increased to more than 6 at a gap ratio of 15, no
	further transition is observed after the transition to tertiary
	wake, and the vortex shedding processes on the downstream
	cylinders become chaotic without a dominant frequency,

	increased step by step: a single flag, double flags, triple
	flags, and a large array of multiple flags were modeled. The
	flexible flags displayed a flapping mode or a fully deflected
	mode, depending on the relationship between the elastic inner
	force and the hydrodynamic force. The bending angle ($\alpha$),
	flapping amplitude (A), and period (T) of the single flag
	decreased as the bending rigidity ($\gamma$) increased. In the
	double and triple flag systems, the bending angle of the first
	flag reached a steady state as the gap distance (d) increased.
	The gap distance affected the position of the flag relative to
	the vortical structures. The vortical structures merged and
	formed a large vortex. Small vortical structures penetrated the
	large gap to drive flag flapping and force flag bending. In a
	large array of multiple flags, all flags were present in the
	fully deflected mode for a small gap distance. As the gap
	distance increased, the interactions between the flags
	increased. The flags were significantly influenced by the inlet
	and exit conditions.",

	abstract  = "The flapping dynamics of vertically clamped three-dimensional
	flags in a Poiseuille flow was studied numerically by using the
	immersed boundary method. First, the flapping dynamics of a
	single flag was explored for comparison. Two distinct flow modes
	were observed: a flapping mode and a deflected mode. In the
	flapping mode, periodic vortices shed from the flag are formed,
	leading to alternating upstroke and downstroke flapping motions
	induced by the hydrodynamic and restoring forces. In the
	deflected mode, the flag is initially deflected by the
	hydrodynamic force and reaches a stationary state; the
	hydrodynamic force is balanced by the restoring force. For
	tandem flags, when the gap distance is small, the flags behave
	as one single flag with a higher bending rigidity. When the gap
	distance is intermediate, the front flag deflects the oncoming
	flow away from the rear flag. The flapping motion of the front
	flag is significantly confined by the presence of the rear flag,
	which results in an attenuation of more than 50\% in its
	flapping amplitude. When the distance is large, the impact of
	the rear flag on the upstream flow field is negligible, so the
	front flag exhibits a flapping amplitude and frequency that are
	similar to those of a single flag. The vortices shed from the
	front flag induce the formation downstream of a low pressure
	region, which results in active flapping in the rear flag with a
	strong amplitude. There are two vortices shed from the tandem
	flags in each flapping period. When they are far apart, the
	phase difference is linearly dependent on the gap distance.",

	author    = "Park, Jeong Woo and Ryu, Jaeha and Sung, Hyung Jin",
	abstract  = "The flapping motion of inverted flags with various shapes in a
	uniform flow was simulated by using the immersed boundary
	method. The shapes of the flags were characterized in terms of
	the shape ratio (S = WT/WL), i.e., the ratio of the trailing
	edge width (WT) to the leading edge width (WL). To explore the
	effects of varying S on the flapping dynamics of inverted flags,
	the peak-to-peak amplitude (A/L) and the Strouhal number (St)
	were determined as functions of the bending rigidity (0.1 $\leq$
	$\gamma$ $\leq$ 0.3) and the shape ratio (0.5 $\leq$ S $\leq$
	2). The vortical structures behind the inverted flag were
	visualized by using the Q-criterion to elucidate the vortex
	dynamics. The hydrodynamic forces exerted on each inverted flag
	were analyzed to find the correlation between its kinematics and
	vortex formation during the flapping period of the inverted
	flag. The strain energy (Es) stored in the inverted flag and the
	ratio (R) of the conversion of flow kinetic energy to strain
	energy were also determined. Finally, we explored the effects of
	varying the shape ratio S′ = WT/WL while keeping the trailing
	edge width constant (WT = 1) instead of the area of the inverted
	flag. The Strouhal number is maximized at S′ = 1. The conversion
	ratio of S′ = 2 is 2.5\% higher than that of S′ = 1.",
